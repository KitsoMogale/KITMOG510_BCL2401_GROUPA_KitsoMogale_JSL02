The project aims to prevent the duplication of goals being added to the goalList element.
I used a for loop to iterate through the goalList element, which contains a list of 'li' elements.
I checked if the contents of each 'li' within the goalList element are equal to the current submitted input,on each iteration.
If they are ,the funtion alerts the user about the duplication and terminates.
